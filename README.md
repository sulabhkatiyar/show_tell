## Implementation of Show and Tell: Neural Image Caption (NIC) Generator model

*Note:* This is a work in progress

In this work, I have re-implemented the paper: [Show and tell: A neural image caption generator](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Vinyals_Show_and_Tell_2015_CVPR_paper.html). This work has been used as baseline in some of my research works where I have compared the performance of this method with other methods in the literature. Hence, to undertake a fair comparison, I have implemented this method with similar hyperparameter settings as other methods that have been studied in my works. 
Thus, there are some differences in this implementation as compared to the method used in the paper. These are as follows:
1. In the paper, authors use GoogLeNet CNN as encoder for image feature extraction but we have used VGG-16 as encoder.
